docent-learner
==============

A web interface which statelessly and randomly traverses digital collections of images or text and asks users to answer questions or tag the content. This was built and designed for quickly creating domain specific training sets for machine learning tasks.

Docent - A person who acts as a guide, typically on a voluntary basis, in a museum, art gallery, or zoo.
Learner - A person who is learning a subject or skill.

Right now the software only supports images, but will soon support text highlighting. If this project continues to be useful, I'll also add support for audio and video.
